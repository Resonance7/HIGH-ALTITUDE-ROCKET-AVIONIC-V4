The name of the board comes from its PCB design. It is the team's first 4-layer embedded system. It is designed in the smallest possible dimensions (36.5 â€“ 87.5 mm) for efficiency. The antenna is positioned so that the total size is minimal. In addition, it has superior features compared to its size.
